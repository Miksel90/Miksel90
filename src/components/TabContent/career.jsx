After living in Stavanger for seven years, it was time to move back home. I started working at Nesoddtangen skole, a primary school. Here I taught English, math, science, and social studies. I was the team leader for the grade I worked in, and also had students in practice every year. Since the school wanted to implement coding, I was chosen to be the school`s coding expert. I started learning coding in 2019. I mainly started with block-coding with my pupils. We built robots, and programmed them to do different tasks. We also started with Minecraft coding. This got me thinking, and I looked into going back to school."
