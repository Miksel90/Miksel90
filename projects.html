              <p>This was Cross course project that with worked on in segments over my first year at Noroff. This was my first asignment
               within design and HTML/CSS. I had never thought about SEO & WCAG before so this was a bit of learning curve from start to finish.</p>
              <P>After focuing on design we were allowed to start implementing javaScript and we added pages that were built dynamically thorught making an
                API call to wordpress. As of now it not completly finished.We were not allowed to use any frameworks or libaries.</P>

              <p>Futurum was our first semester project. We were to use our skills with Figma and then HTML/CSS to build a website for a the new hypotetichal
                musuem that was opening in our hometown.</p>
                <p>The target audience were children aged 7-15 and young families, hence the playful colors.
                  We also had to work with more text on this task so that was a bit of a challenge. We were not allowed to use any frameworks or libaries
                </p>.

              <p>This was our end of year one exam. We had a ton of freedom but we were not allowed to use and frameworks or libaries.
                Everything is built with HTML/CSS/JS. The task was to build a blogsite were the content was dynamically built after fetching data from Wordpress.</p>
              <p>The index page had to include a working image carousel which showcased the latest posts. All specific blog pages had to be dynamically built and all images on the pages had to  modal functionality.</p>
