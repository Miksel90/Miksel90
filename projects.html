              This was a project for the first two courses at my second year a
              Noroff. The task was to build a social platform of some sort. In
              our first course we had two weeks to design the site using
              Bootstrap. We were not allowed to add custom styling.
            </p>
            <p>
              The task was to use the previous project and implement features
              with Javascript. All information was to be gathered from the
              Noroff Social API using different methods. "GET", "PUT", "POST"
              and "DELETE". We also had to save the access token in local
              storage. The user had to have the possibility to communicate with
              others users. In short terms it is a SOME app.

              This was our end of year one exam. We had a ton of freedom but we
              were not allowed to use and frameworks or libaries. Everything is
              built with HTML/CSS/JS. The task was to build a blogsite were the
              content was dynamically built after fetching data from Wordpress.
            </p>
            <p>
              The index page had to include a working image carousel which
              showcased the latest posts. All specific blog pages had to be
              dynamically built and all images on the pages had to modal
              functionality.

              Futurum was our first semester project. We were to use our skills
              with Figma and then HTML/CSS to build a website for a the new
              hypotetichal musuem that was opening in our hometown.
            </p>
            <p>
              The target audience were children aged 7-15 and young families,
              hence the playful colors. We also had to work with more text on
              this task so that was a bit of a challenge. We were not allowed to
              use any frameworks or libaries

              This was a cross course project that we worked on in segments over
              my first year at Noroff. This was my first asignment within design
              and HTML/CSS. I had never thought about SEO & WCAG before so this
              was a steep learning curve from start to finish.
            </p>
            <p>
              After focuing on design we were allowed to start implementing
              javaScript and we added pages that were dynamically built after
              making an API call to wordpress. As of now it not completly
              finished. We were not allowed to use any frameworks or libaries.
